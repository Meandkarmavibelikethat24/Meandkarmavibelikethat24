The self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write or co-write a US platinum-certified album entirely. Taylor Swift was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards and earned Swift a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Having spent 24 weeks at number one on Top Country Albums and peaked at number five on the Billboard 200, Taylor Swift is the longest-charting album of the 2000s decade.</p>
						<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2gP2LMVcIFgVczSJqn340t?si=lK2jkcCYQ_iRiCm_8tLyVQ">Fearless </a> is the second studio album by Taylor Swift.

						<p>Taylor's third studio album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6Ar2o9KCqcyYF9J0aQP3au?si=0f01158067114cb6">Speak Now </a>, released on October 25, 2010, combines country pop, pop rock, and power pop. In the US, it sold one million copies within its first release week, spent six weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified six times platinum. Reflecting Swift's public image, and confessions on love and regret, Speak Now was awarded the American Music Award for Favorite Country Album and Billboard Music Award for Top Country Album in 2011.</p> 
						<p>Through emotions fueled by unhealthy romantic relationships, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1KVKqWeRuXsJDLTW0VuD29?si=c033640113e944fc">Red </a>, Taylor's fourth studio album was released on October 22, 2012. This album sported pop, country, and rock songs. The album spent seven weeks atop the U.S. Billboard 200, making Swift the first female artist to have three consecutive albums spend at least six weeks at number one and certified seven times platinum.</p>
						<p>Taylor Swift's fifth studio album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1yGbNOtRIgdIiGHOEBaZWf?si=12f773d7ffd74463">1989 </a>, her birth year, was released on October 27, 2014, featuring 13 songs inspired by 1980s synth-pop. This album won 3 Grammy Awards including Album of the Year at the 58th Grammy Awards making Swift the first female solo artist to win Album of the Year twice. In the US, 1989 spent 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and was certified ninefold platinum.</p> 
						<p>The sixth studio album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6DEjYFkNZh67HP7R9PSZvv?si=1c2b72d3b4a64746">Reputation </a>, was released on November 10, 2017, mainly encompassing the excessive gossip surrounding her, and finding love during turbulent circumstances. Reputation is an album of experimentation and emotional evolution for Swift; it spent four weeks atop the  Billboard 200 and was the best-selling album by a female artist in 2017, selling over 4.5 million copies.</p> 
						<p>The seventh studio album by Taylor Swift, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1NAmidJlEaVgA3MpcPFYGq?si=a97392dfca864f8b">Lover </a>, was released on August 23, 2019 - this was her first album release after she departed Big Machine Records. Swift conceived Lover as a "love letter to love", taking inspiration from her personal life and artistic freedom. The album explores emotions such as infatuation, commitment, lust, and heartache; and political issues like LGBT rights and feminism. Lover was Swift's sixth-consecutive album to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, winning the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album.</p> 
						<p>The surprise album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1pzvBxYgT6OVwJLtHkrdQK?si=499bb3f6b8054daf">folklore </a>, is the eighth studio album by Swift, released on July 24, 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness" became folklore. Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by neo-classical instruments, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and electroacoustic styles. Influenced by loneliness, Swift explores escapism, empathy, nostalgia, and romanticism in the album, using fictional narratives, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects. Folklore broke the record for the biggest opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act; it won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman in history to win the honor three times.</p>
						<p>The sister album of folklore, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6AORtDjduMM3bupSWzbTSG?si=3bc947f1fac3494d">evermore </a>, is the ninth studio album by Taylor Swift; this is yet another surprise album, released on December 11, 2020. Swift described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods"â€”an escapist, cottagecore-inspired direction she first ideated with folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic. This album is an anthology of tales about love, marriage, infidelity, grief, and exploring the complexities of human emotion. Republic Records reported over a million copies of Evermore sold in its first week globally. It was Swift's eighth consecutive Billboard 200 number-one debut, spending four weeks atop the chart, and marked the shortest gap between two number-one albums by a female act in Australia and the US - becoming 2021's best-selling alternative music album.</p>
