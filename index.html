						<p>The surprise album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1pzvBxYgT6OVwJLtHkrdQK?si=499bb3f6b8054daf">folklore</a>, is the eighth studio album by Swift, released on July 24, 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness" became folklore. Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by neo-classical instruments, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and electroacoustic styles. Influenced by loneliness, Swift explores escapism, empathy, nostalgia, and romanticism in the album, using fictional narratives, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects. Folklore broke the record for the biggest opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act; it won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman in history to win the honor three times.</p>

						<p>The sister album of folklore, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6AORtDjduMM3bupSWzbTSG?si=3bc947f1fac3494d">evermore</a>, is the ninth studio album by Taylor Swift; this is yet another surprise album, released on December 11, 2020. Swift described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods"—an escapist, cottagecore-inspired direction she first ideated with folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic. This album is an anthology of tales about love, marriage, infidelity, grief, and exploring the complexities of human emotion. Republic Records reported over a million copies of Evermore sold in its first week globally. It was Swift's eighth consecutive Billboard 200 number-one debut, spending four weeks atop the chart, and marked the shortest gap between two number-one albums by a female act in Australia and the US - becoming 2021's best-selling alternative music album.</p>

						<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/151w1FgRZfnKZA9FEcg9Z3?si=5c1b5ec01d8140bf">Midnights </a> is the tenth studio album of Taylor Swift, released on October 21, 2022. Announced at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, the album marks Swift's first body of new work since her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. Midnights is a concept album about nocturnal contemplation, written and produced by Swift with longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff.Midnights is about reflection, not reinvention. Taylor Swift has explained that at length, in her own flowery vernacular: These 13 songs are “a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams.” The thoughts that keep the 32-year-old songwriter up late are the ones she’s spent nine albums excavating: the unpredictable rise and devastating fall of romance; the binary of the “good girl” and the “bad girl,” and the chafing of societal expectation and the uncomfortable acceptance of her own fallibility. Life, she declares, “is emotionally abusive.”
